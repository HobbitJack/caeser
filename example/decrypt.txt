"For that which was, will be; and that which will be was.
This is necessary and true.
It is also therefore said (by those who are learned, no doubt) that 'there is that which was, and is not, and will be; and there is also that which was not, is, and will not be.'
Then also are these the same: that which was will again be, and what is now, will not be."
